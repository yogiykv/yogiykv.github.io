<h1>Hi, my name is Yogesh Kumar Verma</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>Recently I got my BTech final year result. Now, I am officially an engineer, like 1.5 million other students who got their degree in engineering with me in our country (our dear INDIA).</p>


<p>I wish I could get back those years of my college life. Time of a lot of studies and a lot of fun. With my friends, I have done so many things, collecting beautiful lifetime memories. But there still remain many areas that could be explored and so many things that to be learned. Things end, but memories last forever. These four years added lots of stories in the book of my life.</p>



<p>College is finished but the thirst of knowledge is still there and
with this in mind that, "Every beginning has an end and every end has a new beginning", I am stepping into the world for which I was preparing for years, with a hope that I could get new challenges every day that will make me stronger and better than yesterday.</p>
